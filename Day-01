Cybersecurity Class – Day 1 Report
Date: 15-07-2025

Topics Covered:
Categories of Hackers:

White Hat: Ethical hackers who assist organizations in strengthening security.

Black Hat: Cybercriminals who exploit vulnerabilities for malicious purposes.

Gray Hat: Hackers who may break the law but do not have malicious intent.

Green Hat: Beginners, often eager to learn and experiment with hacking.

Blue Hat: Individuals who carry out attacks out of revenge or act as testers.

Script Kiddies: Novices who rely on pre-existing hacking tools without deep understanding.

Hacking Phases:

Reconnaissance: Gathering intelligence about the target system.

Scanning: Identifying vulnerabilities, open ports, and services.

Gaining Access: Exploiting system weaknesses to gain unauthorized access.

Maintaining Access: Establishing backdoors for ongoing control.

Clearing Tracks: Erasing traces to avoid detection and ensure continued access.

Common Cyber Threats:

Malware (Viruses, Worms, Trojans)

Ransomware

Spyware and Adware

Social Engineering

Insider Threats

Zero-Day Vulnerabilities

Popular Hacking Techniques:

Phishing: Deceptive attempts to obtain sensitive information through fraudulent communication.

Man-in-the-Middle Attack: Intercepting and potentially altering data in transit.

Keylogging: Recording user keystrokes to steal credentials.

Brute Force Attack: Attempting all possible password combinations to gain access.

Session Hijacking: Taking control of an active user session.

SQL Injection: Inserting malicious code into SQL queries to manipulate databases.

Cybersecurity Teams:

Red Team: Simulates cyberattacks to assess and challenge defenses.

Blue Team: Focuses on defending and responding to real attacks.

Purple Team: Bridges communication between the red and blue teams to improve defense mechanisms.

(Optional) Yellow/Green Teams: Concentrates on security within the design and development stages.

Additional Concepts Introduced:
CIA Triad: Key principles of cybersecurity — Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability.

Familiarization with common cybersecurity tools (Wireshark, Nmap, Burp Suite).

The importance of robust passwords and two-factor authentication.

Basic introduction to Linux terminal commands.

Overview of virtual machines and Kali Linux for penetration testing.

Introduction to ethical hacking principles, as well as relevant laws and regulations.

Reflection:
The first session offered a comprehensive overview of the cybersecurity landscape, introducing key concepts such as hacker types, hacking techniques, and common security threats. The material presented a strong theoretical framework that serves as a solid foundation for the practical skills we’ll be learning in future sessions. It was a good blend of foundational knowledge with real-world relevance, setting the stage for more hands-on activities in the days to come.
