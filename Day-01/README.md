Cybersecurity Class – Day 1 Report
Date: 15-07-2025

Topics Covered
1. Types of Hackers
White Hat – Ethical hackers who assist organizations in identifying and fixing security vulnerabilities.

Black Hat – Malicious hackers who exploit systems for personal or financial gain.

Gray Hat – Hackers who may break laws or violate ethical standards but without malicious intent.

Green Hat – Inexperienced hackers who are eager to learn and develop their skills.

Blue Hat – Individuals motivated by revenge or those hired to test systems before release.

Script Kiddies – Novice hackers who use pre-existing tools without fully understanding them.

2. Phases of Hacking
Reconnaissance – Gathering information about the target system or organization.

Scanning – Identifying open ports, active services, and potential vulnerabilities.

Gaining Access – Exploiting identified weaknesses to enter the system.

Maintaining Access – Installing backdoors or other methods to retain access over time.

Clearing Tracks – Removing evidence to avoid detection or tracing.

3. Types of Threats
Malware (Viruses, Worms, Trojans)

Ransomware – Encrypts files and demands payment for decryption.

Spyware & Adware – Software that secretly collects user data or displays unwanted ads.

Social Engineering – Manipulating individuals to reveal confidential information.

Insider Threats – Risks posed by individuals within an organization.

Zero-Day Exploits – Attacks targeting unknown or unpatched vulnerabilities.

4. Common Hacking Techniques
Phishing – Deceiving users to divulge sensitive data like passwords or credit card details.

Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks – Intercepting and possibly altering communication between two parties.

Keylogging – Recording user keystrokes to steal login credentials or sensitive data.

Brute Force Attacks – Trying every possible combination to crack passwords.

Session Hijacking – Taking over a user’s active session to gain unauthorized access.

SQL Injection – Exploiting database vulnerabilities by injecting malicious SQL commands.

5. Cybersecurity Teams
Red Team – Offensive security experts who simulate real-world attacks.

Blue Team – Defensive team responsible for protecting and monitoring systems.

Purple Team – Acts as a bridge between Red and Blue teams, facilitating collaboration and improving security strategies.

(Optional) Yellow/Green Teams – Focus on integrating security into the software development and design lifecycle.

Additional Concepts (Likely Discussed)
CIA Triad – The core principles of cybersecurity: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

Popular Tools – Tools such as Wireshark, Nmap, and Burp Suite used for network analysis and security testing.

Password Best Practices – Importance of strong passwords and using two-factor authentication (2FA).

Linux Basics – Introduction to using the Linux terminal.

Virtualization & Kali Linux – Overview of using virtual machines and Kali Linux for ethical hacking.

Ethical Hacking & Laws – Understanding the legal and ethical frameworks surrounding cybersecurity.

Reflection
Today's session provided a strong introduction to the fundamentals of cybersecurity. We explored the different types of hackers, the lifecycle of an attack, various threats, and common hacking techniques. The discussion also covered how cybersecurity teams are structured and the tools professionals use. Overall, the session balanced foundational theory with real-world examples, setting the groundwork for more practical, hands-on learning in the days to come.
