Cybersecurity Class – Day 3 Report
Date: 22-03-2025
Topic: Introduction to Basic Kali Linux Commands
Environment: Kali Linux (VirtualBox on Windows)
Mode: Hands-on Terminal Practice

What We Did Today
In today’s session, we focused on becoming familiar with the Kali Linux terminal. The class was hands-on, allowing us to directly execute and observe a variety of essential Linux commands. These commands form the foundation for navigating the system, managing files and directories, and retrieving system information.

By actively typing commands into the terminal and analyzing their output, we gained practical experience and a deeper understanding of how each command functions.

Commands We Practiced
Command	Description
pwd	Displays the current working directory.
ls	Lists files and directories in the current location.
cd <directory>	Changes to the specified directory.
mkdir <foldername>	Creates a new directory.
touch <filename>	Creates a new, empty file.
cat <filename>	Displays the contents of a file.
rm <filename>	Deletes a file.
rmdir <foldername>	Deletes an empty directory.
clear	Clears the terminal screen.
whoami	Displays the current logged-in user.
uname -a	Shows detailed system information.
ifconfig	Displays network interface configurations.
history	Lists all previously executed commands in the session.

Key Takeaways
While working with the terminal can be intimidating at first, consistent practice makes it significantly easier.

Mastering basic navigation and file operations using the command line is a fundamental skill in Linux-based cybersecurity environments.

Understanding the purpose and effect of each command is more important than memorizing them all at once.

Most Linux commands follow a logical structure and can be extended using options and arguments for additional functionality.

Looking Ahead
In the next session, we will delve into file permissions and ownership using commands such as chmod, chown, and ls -l. We also anticipate beginning our exploration of basic networking tools and learning how to redirect command output in the terminal.
