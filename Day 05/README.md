Date:1-8-2025
On Day 5 of this hands-on lab, you’ll dive into Villain, a modern and versatile command-and-control (C2) framework designed to manage and enhance reverse shell sessions within Kali Linux.

Key Highlights:
What is Villain?
Villain is an open-source Stage 0/1 C2 framework that streamlines managing multiple reverse TCP and HoaxShell-based shells. It enriches these shells with enhanced functionalities like built-in utilities, payload generation, and obfuscation options
